#Fundamentals-of-NLP-I

Explores the computational properties of natural language and the foundations of the algorithms used to process it. Developa an understanding of basic statistical natural language processing (NLP) methods by implementing language analysis and classification algorithms in Python. Topics include corpus statistics, text classification, language modeling, and the computational techniques needed to support these tasks, with a focus on generative models (e.g., naive Bayes, hidden Markov models).
